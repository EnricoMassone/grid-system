# Grid system

This project is insprired by chapter four of the book [CSS in depth](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth).  
This is both a way for me to fix the concepts illustrated there and an useful reference for anyone interested in learning CSS. 

This project illustrates how to build a *grid system* by using *float* as the base tool to define rows and columns. The grid system is applied to the layout of an HTML page where it is also illustrated how to get a *media object* by using floats. 

## How to run the sample page

Clone or download the repository and follow these steps: 

 - `cd grid-system`
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn run start`
